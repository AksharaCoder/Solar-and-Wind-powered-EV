# Solar-and-Wind-powered-EV

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing a solar and wind power–based electric vehicle system to understand the use of renewable energy sources for sustainable transportation. The system demonstrates how solar and wind energy can be used to charge batteries and power an electric vehicle.
This is a hardware-based ECE project, supported with documentation, images, and basic control logic.

🎯 Objective
To utilize renewable energy sources (solar and wind) for electric vehicle operation
To reduce dependency on fossil fuels
To understand power generation, storage, and energy management in EV systems

System Description
